    - title: "Back to Square 1"
      date: 2020-10-15
      summary: Solving this problem is very easy and only requires a few lines of code if you know what Markov Chains are. After modeling the problem as a Markov Chain, the solution is just a matter of finding the expected number of steps required to reach the desired state.

      date: 2020-10-28
      summary: Here I will discuss the most efficient way to calculate the nth Fibonacci under modulo. This is a typical Fibonacci problem, but with a twist. The twist comes because of the modulo operation. This causes the fibonacci sequence to repeat itself after a certain point.

    - title: "Kabloom"
      date: 2020-10-14
      summary: This problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming. The idea is to find the optimal alignment of two strings (i.e. edit distance) that maximizes the cost of the alignment.
