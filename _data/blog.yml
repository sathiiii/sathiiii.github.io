  - title: "Solving a Pocket Cube"
    date: 2022-10-07
    summary: The 2x2x2 Rubik's Cube, also known as the Pocket Cube, is the smaller version of the Rubik's Cubes which might seem to be a lot easier to solve. But is it really? I will be discussing how to use A star search with many other interesting techniques to efficiently solve the Pocket Cube.

  - title: "Back to Square 1"
    date: 2020-10-15
    summary: Solving this problem is very easy and only requires a few lines of code if you know what Markov Chains are. After modeling the problem as a Markov Chain, the solution is just a matter of finding the expected number of steps required to reach the desired state.

    date: 2020-10-28
    summary: Here I will discuss the most efficient way to calculate the nth Fibonacci under modulo. This is a typical Fibonacci problem, but with a twist. The twist comes because of the modulo operation. This causes the fibonacci sequence to repeat itself after a certain point.

    date: 2020-10-14
    summary: This problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming. The idea is to find the optimal alignment of two strings (i.e. edit distance) that maximizes the cost of the alignment.
